# Development Environment

## Tools Used
{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}

### GitHub
>GitHub is a place where programmers store, share, and collaborate on their code, making it easier to work on big projects together and keep track of all the changes. It's like a big, organized playground for building digital stuff.

- Why I used it: to share my code and save it which helped keep track of my changes and show me when I did each change. It also allows me to share it so others like you can look at it.

### Visual Code Studio
>Visual Studio Code is friendly, free, and smart computer program that makes writing and working with code easier, whether you're building websites, apps, games, or anything else that uses computer languages. It's like having a helpful assistant by your side as you explore the world of coding.

- Why I used it: to create and run my software.

## Programming Language Used
Today for this software I used the programmings language used was:  
**Python**
>Python is a widely-used, beginner-friendly programming language known for its simplicity and versatility. It's applied in web development, data analysis, AI, and more. Python's readability and extensive library support make it a top choice for both new and experienced programmers.

- Why I used it today? you may ask: well using Python for this software like `"Hello, World!"` is a friendly and practical choice for newcomers to programming, helping them quickly grasp the fundamental concepts like `print()` while experiencing the satisfaction of seeing their code in action.
